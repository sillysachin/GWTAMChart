If autoMargin is true and bottom side has axis, this property is ignored."marginLeft	Number	20	double	"Number of pixels between the container's left border and plot area. This space can be used for left axis' values. If autoMargin is true and left side has axis, this property is ignored."marginRight	Number	20	double	"Number of pixels between the container's right border and plot area.

Value range is 0 - 1.plotAreaBorderColor	Color	#000000	String	"The color of the plot area's border. Note, the it is invisible by default, as plotAreaBorderAlpha default value is 0. Set it to a value higher than 0 to make it visible."plotAreaFillAlphas	Number	0	double	"Opacity of plot area. Plural form is used to keep the same property names as our Flex charts'. Flex charts can accept array of numbers to generate gradients. Although you can set array here, only first value of this array will be used."plotAreaFillColors	Color	#FFFFFF	String	"You can set both one color if you need a solid color or array of colors to generate gradients, for example: ['#000000', '#0000CC']"plotAreaGradientAngle	Number	0	double	"If you are using gradients to fill the plot area, you can use this property to set gradient angle. The only allowed values are horizontal and vertical: 0, 90, 180, 270."trendLines	Array[TrendLine]		List<IsTrendLine>	Array of trend lines added to a chart.
