Field Name	JS Datatype	Default	Java Datatype	DescriptionautoRotateAngle	Number		double	"Angle of label rotation, if the number of series exceeds autoRotateCount and parseDates is set to false."autoRotateCount	Number		double	"If the number of category axis items will exceed the autoRotateCount, the labels will be rotated by autoRotateAngle degree. Works only if parseDates is false."autoWrap	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if axis labels (only when it is horizontal) should be wrapped if they don't fit in the allocationted space. Wrapping won't work for rotated axis labels.boldPeriodBeginning	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	"When parse dates is on for the category axis, the chart will try to highlight the beginning of the periods, like month, in bold. Set this to false to disable the functionality."categoryFunction			IsFunction	"specifies a method that returns the value that should be used as categoryValue for current item. If this property is set, the return value of the custom data function takes precedence over categoryField. When a chart calls this method, it passes category value, data item from chart's data provider and reference to categoryAxis: categoryFunction(category, dataItem, categoryAxis); This method can be used both when category axis parses dates and when it doesn't. If axis parses dates, your categoryFunction should return Date object. For example, if you have date strings in your data, you can use this method to convert these strings into Date objects."""centerLabelOnFullPeriod	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	"This setting works only when parseDates is set to true and equalSpacing is set to false. In case you set it to false, labels will never be centered between grid lines."dateFormats	Array[Object]	"[{period:'fff',format:'JJ:NN:SS'},{period:'ss',format:'JJ:NN:SS'},{period:'mm',format:'JJ:NN'},{period:'hh',format:'JJ:NN'},{period:'DD',format:'MMM DD'},{period:'WW',format:'MMM DD'},{period:'MM',format:'MMM'},{period:'YYYY',format:'YYYY'}]"	List<JavaScriptObject>	"Date formats of different periods. Possible period values: fff - milliseconds, ss - seconds, mm - minutes, hh - hours, DD - days, MM - months, WW - weeks, YYYY - years. Check this page for date formatting strings."equalSpacing	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"In case your category axis values are Date objects and parseDates is set to true, the chart will parse dates and will place your data points at irregular intervals. However if you want dates to be parsed (displayed on the axis, baloons, etc), but data points to be placed at equal intervals (omiting dates with no data), set equalSpacing to true."firstDayOfWeek	Number	1	double	"Sets first day of the week. 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc."forceShowField	String		String	"Field in data provider which specifies if the category value should always be shown. For example: categoryAxis.forceShowField = 'forceShow'; And in data: {category:'one', forceShow:true, value:100} Note, this works only when parseDates is set to false."gridPosition	String	middle	String	Specifies if a grid line is placed on the center of a cell or on the beginning of a cell. Possible values are: 'start' and 'middle' This setting doesn't work if parseDates is set to true.labelColorField	String		String	You can use it to set color of a axis label. Works only with non-date-based data.labelFunction			IsFunction	"You can use this function to format Category axis labels. If this function is set, then it is called with the following parameters passed: if dates are not parsed: labelFunction(valueText, serialDataItem, categoryAxis) if dates are parsed: labelFunction(valueText, date, categoryAxis) Your function should return string which will be displayed on the axis."markPeriodChange	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	"If you set it to false, the start of longer periods won't use a different date format and won't be bold."minPeriod	String	DD	String	"Specifies the shortest period of your data. This should be set only if parseDates is set to 'true'. Possible period values: fff - milliseconds, ss - seconds, mm - minutes, hh - hours, DD - days, MM - months, YYYY - years. It's also possible to supply a number for increments, i.e. '15mm' which will instruct the chart that your data is supplied in 15 minute increments."parseDates	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"In case your category axis values are Date objects, set this to true. In this case the chart will parse dates and will place your data points at irregular intervals. If you want dates to be parsed, but data points to be placed at equal intervals, set both parseDates and equalSpacing to true."startOnAxis	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"Specifies whether the graph should start on axis or not. In case you display columns, it is recommended to set this to false. If parseDates is set to true, startOnAxis will allways be false, unless equalSpacing is set to true."tickPosition	String	middle	String	Position of a axis tick. Works only with non-date-based data.twoLineMode	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"Works only when parseDates is set to true and equalSpacing is false. If you set it to true, at the position where bigger period changes, category axis will display date strings of bot small and big period, in two rows."
