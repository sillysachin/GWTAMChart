Field Name	JS Datatype	Default	Java Datatype	Javadoc Commentadjustment	Number	0	double	"If you set adjustment to -1, the balloon will be shown near previous, if you set it to 1 - near next data point."animationDuration	Number	0.3	double	"Duration of animation of a line, in seconds."avoidBalloonOverlapping	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	"Specifies if cursor should arrange balloons so they won't overlap. If chart is rotated, it might be good idea to turn this off."bulletsEnabled	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if bullet for each graph will follow the cursor.bulletSize	Number	8	double	"Size of bullets, following the cursor."categoryBalloonAlpha	Number	1	double	Opacity of the category balloon.categoryBalloonColor	Color		String	Color of the category balloon. cursorColor is used if not set.categoryBalloonDateFormat	String	"MMM DD, YYYY"	String	Category balloon date format (used only if category axis parses dates). Check this page for instructions on how to format dates.categoryBalloonEnabled	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	Specifies whether category balloon is enabled.categoryBalloonFunction			IsFunction	"Allows formatting any category balloon text you want. categoryBalloonFunction should return a string which will be displayed in a balloon. When categoryBalloonFunction is called, category value (or date) is passed as an argument."color	Color	#FFFFFF	String	Text color.cursorAlpha	Number	1	double	Opacity of the cursor line.cursorColor	Color	#CC0000	String	Color of the cursor line.cursorPosition	String	middle	String	"Specifies where the cursor line should be placed - on the beginning of the period (day, hour, etc) or in the middle (only when parseDates property of categoryAxis is set to true). If you want the cursor to follow mouse and not to glue to the nearest data point, set 'mouse' here. Possible values are: start, middle, mouse."enabled	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	Specifies whether cursor is enabled.fullWidth	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If set to true, instead of a cursor line user will see a fill which width will always be equal to the width of one data item. We'd recommend setting cusrsorAlpha to 0.1 or some other small number if using this feature."graphBulletAlpha	Number		double	"If you make graph's bullets invisible by setting their opacity to 0 and will set graphBulletAlpha to 1, the bullets will only appear at the cursor's position."graphBulletSize	Number	1.7	double	"Size of a graph's bullet (if available) at the cursor position. If you don't want the bullet to change it's size, set this property to 1."oneBalloonOnly	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If this is set to true, only one balloon at a time will be displayed. Note, this is quite CPU consuming."pan	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If this is set to true, the user will be able to pan the chart (Serial only) instead of zooming."selectionAlpha	Number	0.2	double	Opacity of the selection.selectWithoutZooming	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if cursor should only mark selected area but not zoom-in after user releases mouse button.showNextAvailable	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If true, the graph will display balloon on next available data point if currently hovered item doesn't have value for this graph."valueBalloonsEnabled	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	"Specifies whether value balloons are enabled. In case they are not, the balloons might be displayed anyway, when the user rolls-over the column or bullet."valueLineAlpha	Number		double	Opacity of value line. Will use cursorAlpha value if not set.valueLineAxis	ValueAxis		IsValueAxis	"Axis of value line. If you set valueLineBalloonEnabled to true, but you have more than one axis, you can use this property to indicate which axis should display balloon."valueLineBalloonEnabled	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"Specifies if value balloon next to value axis labels should be displayed. If you have more than one axis, set valueLineAxis property to indicate which axis should display the balloon."valueLineEnabled	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if cursor of Serial chart should display horizontal (or vertical if chart is rotated) line. This line might help users to compare distant values of a chart. You can also enable value balloon on this line by setting valueLineAxis property of ChartCursor.zoomable	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	"Specifies if the user can zoom-in the chart. If pan is set to true, zoomable is switched to false automatically."zooming	Boolean		boolean	Read-only. Indicates if currently user is selecting some chart area to zoom-in.
