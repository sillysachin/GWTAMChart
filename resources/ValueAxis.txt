Field Name	JS Datatype	Default	Java Datatype	DescriptionaxisTitleOffset	Number	10	double	Radar chart only. Specifies distance from axis to the axis title (category)baseCoord	Number		double	Read-only. Coordinate of the base value.baseValue	Number	0	double	Specifies base value of the axis.duration	String		String	"If your values represents time units, and you want value axis labels to be formatted as duration, you have to set the duration unit. Possible values are: 'ss', 'mm', 'hh' and 'DD'."durationUnits	Object	"{DD:'d. ', hh:':', mm:':',ss:''}"	JavaScriptObject	"If duration property is set, you can specify what string should be displayed next to day, hour, minute and second."gridType	String	polygons	String	Radar chart only. Possible values are: 'polygons' and 'circles'. Set 'circles' for polar charts.id	String		String	"Unique id of value axis. It is not required to set it, unless you need to tell the graph which exact value axis it should use."includeGuidesInMinMax	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies whether guide values should be included when calculating min and max of the axis.includeHidden	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If true, the axis will include hidden graphs when calculating min and max values."integersOnly	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies whether values on axis can only be integers or both integers and doubles.labelFunction			IsFunction	"You can use this function to format Value axis labels. This function is called and these parameters are passed: labelFunction(value, valueText, valueAxis); Where value is numeric value, valueText is formatted string and valueAxis is a reference to valueAxis object. Your function should return string."logarithmic	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if this value axis' scale should be logarithmic.max	Number		double	Read-only. Maximum value of the axis.maximum	Number		double	"If you don't want max value to be calculated by the chart, set it using this property. This value might still be adjusted so that it would be possible to draw grid at rounded intervals."min	Number		double	Read-only. Minimum value of the axis.minimum	Number		double	"If you don't want min value to be calculated by the chart, set it using this property. This value might still be adjusted so that it would be possible to draw grid at rounded intervals."minMaxMultiplier	Number	1	double	"If set value axis scale (min and max numbers) will be multiplied by it. I.e. if set to 1.2 the scope of values will increase by 20 percent.precision	Number		double	Precision (number of decimals) of values.radarCategoriesEnabled	Boolean	TRUE	boolean	Radar chart only. Specifies if categories (axes' titles) should be displayed near axes)recalculateToPercents	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if graphs's values should be recalculated to percents.reversed	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	Specifies if value axis should be reversed (smaller values on top).stackType	String	none	String	"Stacking mode of the axis. Possible values are: 'none', 'regular', '100 percent', '3d'. Note, only graphs of one type will be stacked."step	Number		double	Read-only. Value difference between two grid lines.synchronizationMultiplier	Number		double	"In case you synchronize one value axis with another, you need to set the synchronization multiplier. Use synchronizeWithAxis method to set with which axis it should be synced."synchronizeWith	ValueAxis		IsValueAxis	One value axis can be synchronized with another value axis. You can use both reference to your axis or id of the axis here. You should set synchronizationMultiplyer in order for this to work.totalText	String		String	"If this value axis is stacked and has columns, setting valueAxis.totalText = '[[total]]' will make it to display total value above the most-top column."totalTextColor	Color		String	Color of total text.treatZeroAs	Number	0	double	This allows you to have logarithmic value axis and have zero values in the data. You must set it to >0 value in order to work.unit	String		String	Unit which will be added to the value label.unitPosition	String	right	String	Position of the unit. Possible values are 'left' and 'right'.usePrefixes	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If true, prefixes will be used for big and small numbers. You can set arrays of prefixes directly to the chart object via prefixesOfSmallNumbers and prefixesOfBigNumbers."useScientificNotation	Boolean	FALSE	boolean	"If true, values will always be formatted using scientific notation (5e+8, 5e-8...) Otherwise only values bigger then 1e+21 and smaller then 1e-7 will be displayed in scientific notation."
